ArgosMiner is a stream-based process mining system written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It collects events from various sources and traces the underlying discovered process models over time. 

The following three key features distinguish ArgosMiner from other process mining systems:
- Focus on time
- Focus on change
- Focus on operational simplicity

ArgosMiner is a single binary without external dependencies, such as a database. It can be used in client as well as server scenarios. While the latter is our primary focus, ArgosMiner can also be used on a client to quickly analyze (large) event logs.
